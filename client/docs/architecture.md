# Angular E-Commerce Application Architecture

## Overview

This Angular application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, implementing best practices for scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Modular Design
- **Core Module**: Contains singleton services and global functionality
- **Shared Module**: Contains reusable components and utilities
- **Feature Modules**: Self-contained modules for specific features
- **Lazy Loading**: Feature modules are lazy-loaded for better performance

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Components**: Handle UI logic and user interactions
- **Services**: Handle business logic and data management
- **Guards**: Handle route protection and authorization
- **Interceptors**: Handle cross-cutting concerns (auth, errors)

### 3. Reactive Programming
- Uses RxJS observables for data flow
- Implements reactive forms for user input
- Uses subjects for component communication

### 4. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface definitions for all data models

## Core Services

### AuthService
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Manages JWT tokens
- Provides user state management

### ErrorService
- Centralized error handling
- HTTP error processing
- Error logging and reporting

### ToastService
- Global notification system
- Success, error, warning, and info messages
- Configurable display duration

### LoggingService
- Application logging
- Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Environment-based logging configuration

## Guards

### AuthGuard
- Protects routes requiring authentication
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login

### RoleGuard
- Protects routes based on user roles
- Supports multiple role-based access control

## Interceptors

### AuthInterceptor
- Automatically adds JWT tokens to HTTP requests
- Handles token refresh logic

### ErrorInterceptor
- Global HTTP error handling
- Automatic logout on 401 errors
- User-friendly error messages

## State Management

The application uses a service-based state management approach:
- Services maintain state using BehaviorSubjects
- Components subscribe to state changes
- Reactive patterns for data flow

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
- Feature modules are lazy-loaded
- Reduces initial bundle size
- Improves application startup time

### OnPush Change Detection
- Components use OnPush change detection strategy
- Reduces unnecessary change detection cycles
- Improves runtime performance

### Image Optimization
- Lazy loading directive for images
- Placeholder images during loading
- Optimized image formats

## Security

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Route-level protection
- Component-level permissions

### Input Validation
- Form validation using reactive forms
- Custom validators for business rules
- XSS protection through Angular's built-in sanitization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component testing with Angular Testing Utilities
- Service testing with dependency injection
- Pipe and directive testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- API integration testing
- User workflow testing

## Build and Deployment

### Development
- Hot module replacement for fast development
- Source maps for debugging
- Development-specific configurations

### Production
- Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation
- Tree shaking for smaller bundles
- Minification and compression
- Environment-specific configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Reusable and composable components
   - Clear input/output interfaces

2. **Service Design**
   - Singleton services for shared state
   - Dependency injection for testability
   - Error handling and logging

3. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for large features
   - OnPush change detection
   - Efficient data structures

5. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
